<div class="about">
<p>
	Violet Impact Designs was created two years ago based on our ambition to create unique designs for you and your loved ones. <span id="span">Being a graphic design artist was our dream that stretched as far back as during high school.</span> Specialized in logo and print design during a course in a duel enrollment program. <span id="span2">I would later take interests in poster designs as it is often one of the most popular design choices to date.</span> <span id="span3">The idea behind our business is based on how graphics and illustrions are designed in posters such as movie posters, advertisements, and wallpapers. </span><span id="span4">These designs are perfectly crafted and are always ready for commercial use.</span>
